### Data Structure

The app uses a JSON-based seed data system with the following structure:

```json
{
  "chapters": [
    {
      "id": "ch1",
      "index": 1,
      "title_en": "Arjuna's Despair",
      "title_sa": "‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡•Å‡§®‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ‡§¶‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó"
    }
  ],
  "verses": [
    {
      "id": "v2_47",
      "chapter_index": 2,
      "verse_index": 47,
      "devanagari_text": "‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á...",
      "iast_text": "karma·πáy-evƒÅdhikƒÅras te ...",
      "translation_en": "You have a right to action alone...",
      "keywords": ["karma", "detachment"],
      "audio_url": "bundle://audio/v2_47.mp3",

      "themes": ["duty", "equanimity"]
    }
  ],
  "lessons": [...],
  "exercises": [...]
}
```

### Spaced Repetition System

Implements a simplified Leitner box system:

- **Box 1**: 1 day interval (new items)
- **Box 2**: 3 day interval
- **Box 3**: 7 day interval
- **Box 4**: 14 day interval
- **Box 5**: 30 day interval

Items move up on correct answers, reset to Box 1 on incorrect answers.

### Audio System

- **Bundled Audio**: High-quality MP3 files for key verses
- **TTS Fallback**: AVSpeechSynthesizer for missing audio
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, speed adjustment
- **Word-level Audio**: Individual word pronunciation
